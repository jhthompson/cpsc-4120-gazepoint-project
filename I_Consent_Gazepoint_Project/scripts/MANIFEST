The main Python scripts that may need to be altered are:

csv2raw.py:
  - this converts the .csv files to .raw files
  - this is also a good opportunity to settle on file naming conventions, e.g.,
    p1_cond1_stim1_etc_etc.raw
    where you encode subj ids and conditions, etc. into the file name

graph.py:
  - this processes each .raw file and visualizes whatever is ucommented
    in the visualization
  - this also takes into account the file naming scheme above

filter.py:
  - this is very similar to graph.py and will probably require similar
    changes, e.g., taking care about file nameing scheme used above
  - this will convert .raw files into .dat files, collecting for each
    file the number of fixations per AOI for example

collate-*.py:
  - these scripts assemble all relevant data/*.dat files into .csv
    fils for further processing by R
  - again, the file naming scheme will be important here

*.R:
  - R files will need to be tailored according to your experimental
    design and the output of your collate-*.py scripts
